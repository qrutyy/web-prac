  ls-bdd-h: "LS-BDD (Implementation of Log-Structured block device in Linux kernel)"
  ls-bdd-b1: "Modern data storage systems (DSS) demand high performance from HDD I/O operations, which can be optimized using hardware and software solutions. In Linux, block devices serve as the software abstraction for HDDs, enabling data processing by interacting with fixed-size blocks. To improve HDD performance under random workloads, a log-structured approach is proposed, redirecting random writes to a sequential log to minimize access delays. Selecting an efficient data structure, such as the B+ tree, is crucial for mapping data block addresses, as it supports fast sequential searches and updates. Even though, log-structured storage isn't new â€” further research is needed to refine this approach and explore alternative data structures for optimal implementation."
  ls-bdd-b2: "LS-BDD is a block device driver that implements log-structured storage based on B+-tree, RB-tree, Skiplist and Hashtable data structures. Driver is based on BIO request management and supports BIO split. Block device's integrity was twice tested, using manual scripts and FIO."
